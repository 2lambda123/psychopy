Running and sharing studies online
=======================================

Online studies are realized via PsychoJS; the online counterpart of PsychoPy. To run your study online, these are the basic steps:

1. :doc:`Check whether the features you need are supported by PsychoJS <status>`
2. :doc:`Convert your media (images, sound, and video) to online-suitable formats <mediaFormats>`
3. :doc:`Register an account on Pavlovia <usingPavlovia>`
4. :doc:`Generate a JavaScript experiment and upload it to Pavlovia <fromBuilder>`

Besides the basics, we've got the following tutorials:

- :doc:`How to code and debug PsychoJS experiments <psychoJSCodingDebugging>`
- :doc:`How to share your experiment with other researchers <sharingExperiments>`
- :doc:`How to recruit participants and connect with online services <onlineParticipants>`
- :doc:`How to counterbalance participants across conditions <counterbalancingOnline>`
- :doc:`Caveats and cautions (timing accuracy and web-browser support) <cautions>`
- :doc:`How does it work? <tech>`
- :doc:`Manually coding PsychoJS studies <psychojsCode>`

The first generation of PsychoJS was realized by a `Wellcome Trust <https://wellcome.org/>`_ grant, awarded in January 2018.  to make online studies possible from PsychoPy. This is what we call PsychoPy3 - the 3rd major phase of PsychoPy's development.
