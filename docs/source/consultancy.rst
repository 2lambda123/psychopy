Consultancy services
-------------------------------

We will try to offer as much technical support as possible for free via the `forum <discourse.psychopy.org>`_ as well as offering `free training events <https://workshops.psychopy.org/3hrs/index.html>`_. However, if you're **short on time but have spare funds**, or you are **seeking some specific training** we can offer more bespoke support. For enquiries please contact consultancy@opensciencetools.org. 


What can we offer?
--------------------------------

We can be quite flexible in what we offer, but to give you an idea of what is possible:

*	**Task creation** -  Short on time but have spare funds? Need a task creating? Our team of experts can help create a task to fit your brief.
*	**Debugging assistance**  - Have you developed a task that needs a few tweaks you are stuck on? In general we try to offer as much support for this for free via the `forum <discourse.psychopy.org>`_    but if you want to enhance your learning via one-to-one or small group chats get in touch!
*	**Small group training**  - If you would like a departmenal workshop tailored to a broad audience (assuming begginer knowledge of PsychoPy) we offer 3Hr sessions at a small fee of Â£100 per session. Alternatively, if you and your lab group would like to learn about specific aspects of PsychoPy (for example learn how to create a specific type of task), we can tailor something for you.
