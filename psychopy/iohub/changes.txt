Changes made to iohub for 2021.2 Release
----------------------------------------

- Removed iohub ExpRuntime class (use iohub.launchHubServer() function)
- Some eye tracker setting haves may have changed. If running an experiment created with a previous version of iohub,
  please review your eye tracker settings and update as necessary.
    - Do we need to list every specific setting change?
- iohub can no longer be copied out of the psychopy package and used as a stand alone package
  in your site-packages folder. Change `import iohub` to `import psychopy.iohub` for example.
- Removed most device settings related to device hardware specifics (model_id, manufacturer_date, etc)
  since they were never really used.
- removed use of .iohpid
- ** Changed datastore schema:
    - increased experiment and session data string max length
- Added wintab device for Wacom based digital pens. (Windows only)
- Added iohub MouseGaze eye tracker simulator.
- Added 'color_space' setting to Display settings.
- Eyelink and tobii calibration gfx can now use same color space as window instead of always rgb255.
    - TODO: Retest all eyetracking examples with all eye trackers on all OS's
- Removed iohub/devices/display/unit_conversions.py. Moving to psychopy monitorutil functions.
- launchHubServer now accepts a psychopy window using the window kwarg.
  iohub display info is updated using window information like .monitor, .colorSpace, .units, .screen
- If psychopy window (with monitor config) is passed to launchHubServer,
  user can forget about need for iohub Display config.
