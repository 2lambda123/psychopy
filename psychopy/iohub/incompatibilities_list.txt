List of iohub functionality that has been removed or changed as part of the 2021 refactor work
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Removed iohub ExpRuntime class (use iohub.launchHubServer() function)
- Some eye tracker setting haves may have changed. If running an experiment created with a previous version of iohub,
  please review your eye tracker settings and update as necessary.
    - Do we need to list every specific setting change?
- iohub can no longer be copied out of the psychopy package and used as a stand alone package
  in your site-packages folder. Change `import iohub` to `import psychopy.iohub` for example.
- Removed most device settings related to device hardware specifics (model_id, manfacture_date, etc)
  since they were never really used.
