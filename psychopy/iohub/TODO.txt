TODO list / iohub 2021 rework project notes

- Python 3 only support is OK

- Test / start developing with Python 3.9

- remove any areas of logic dealing with Python 2 vs Python 3 incompatibilities.

- iohub __init__.py: is fix_encoding.fix_encoding() still needed?
  It is based on old Python issues that may not longer be needed.
  If we remove it, remove fix_encoding.py file as well.

- switch iohub source code copywrite to standard psychopy text.

- remove need for / use of experiment_config.yaml. Determine what functionality this will affect.

- ?? switch from .yaml files to python dict structure.

- ?? macos keyboard and mouse events: Add event delay to correct for _minimum_ possible event delay.

- Remove following sections of iohub:
    - As much of iohub.utils.* as possible.
    - [Done] Complete removal of iohub.client.expruntime.py

- Documentation ideas:
    - ioHub Developer 'Notes'
    - Psychopy ioHub User Docs
        - Saving data using ioHub DataStore:
            - device events
            - experiment and session meta data
            - condition variables table
            - hdf5 file structure
            - reading data / doing analysis from hdf5 files

- Some bigger issues that would be good to address:
    - Consistent iohub Error / exception reporting framework:
        - communication of issues to client process.
        - reporting of issues by client process
    - Consistent device status reporting after client starts iohub process.
    - Create files in user writable folder (use OS specific standard folders)
