TODO list / iohub 2021 rework project notes

- Python 3 only support is OK

- Test / start developing with Python 3.9

- remove any areas of logic dealing with Python 2 vs Python 3 incompatibilities.

- remove unneeded params from all supported_config_settings.yaml/default_device.yaml files, like:
        - manufacture_date: DD-MM-YYYY
        - software_version: N/A
        - hardware_version: N/A
        - firmware_version: N/A

- switch iohub source code copywrite to standard psychopy text.

- macos keyboard and mouse events:
    - switch from polling method of CFRunLoopRunInMode to threaded approach used by eventmp.
    - if that is not enough, reimplement using usb sniffer or just correct timestamp
      for _minimum_ possible event delay.

- ?? remove need for / use of experiment_config.yaml. Determine what functionality this will affect.

- ?? switch from .yaml files to python dict structure.

- ?? revert to server side only devices / events accessed via RPC.
    - remove iohub.client.keyboard.py and iohub.client.wintab.py
    - move any needed methods / functionality to the server side device class, or deprecate.
    - experiment would now get 'native' iohub keyboard and wintab events, which is not backwards compatible.

- Documentation ideas:
    - ioHub Developer 'Notes'
    - Psychopy ioHub User Docs
        - Saving data using ioHub DataStore:
            - device events
            - experiment and session meta data
            - condition variables table
            - hdf5 file structure
            - reading data / doing analysis from hdf5 files

- Some bigger issues that would be good to address:
    - Consistent iohub Error / exception reporting framework:
        - communication of issues to client process.
        - reporting of issues by client process
    - Consistent device status reporting after client starts iohub process.
    - Create files in user writable folder (use OS specific standard folders)
