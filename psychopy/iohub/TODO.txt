        - Saving data using ioHub DataStore:
            - device events
            - experiment and session meta data

- Some bigger issues that would be good to address:
    - Consistent iohub Error / exception reporting framework:
        - communication of issues to client process.
        - reporting of issues by client process
    - Consistent device status reporting after client starts iohub process.
    - Create files in user writable folder (use OS specific standard folders)
