  for your calibration routine have been set to {value}

# The following are typically used for online help pages, and support reStructured Text.
label: Custom target positions not used

synopsis: |
  Some eyetrackers do not support custom target positions in their calibration routine, instead they have to be chosen
  from a set of options (e.g. `"NINE_POINTS"`). This means that, if you have specified the positions of target stimuli
  in your calibration routine to be a list of custom coordinates, PsychoPy will choose the closest pre-set value.

solutions: |
  If you are only using the current eyetracker to test an experiment and will be using one which supports custom
  target positions, then you don't need to do anything. This alert will stop appearing when you use the other
  eyetracker.

  Otherwise, you just need to be aware that the positions of the target on screen will not necessarily correspond
  to the values you supplied due to the limitations of the eyetracker you are using.
