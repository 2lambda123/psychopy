Visual search task with eye tracking
===============================================

This is a variant of the visual search experiment originally described in
Chapter 9. In Chapter 19, we show how to use an eye tracker to monitor eye
movements whilst the participant is performing the task.

When the experiment starts, enter the name of the eye tracker configuration
file to use for the experiment in the 'Eye Tracker config:' field. 
Example configuration files for GazePoint (gazepoint_config.yaml), 
SR Research (eyelink_config.yaml), and Tobii (tobii_config.yaml) eye trackers
are included for reference. You can edit the eye tracker configuration file
if the default settings are not appropriate for your desired system configuration.
  
You may also need to install the SDK (software development kit) or
API (application programming interface) provided by your particular eye tracker
manufacturer.
